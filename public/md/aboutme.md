## About Me

Hey there! I'm Harold, a current student at the Australian National University (ANU) pursuing an Advanced
Computing Research & Development honours degree. I am passionate and eager to learn about many sub-fields in 
computer science, such as cybersecurity, cryptography, software engineering, machine learning and computer architecture.
This website aims to serve as my CV, showing off my projects and academic achievements. My contact details is also
displayed on this website. 

### Software Engineering

I am highly experienced with Java, and proficient in Python, C, Javascript, HTML/CSS and ARM assembly. I started coding
in 2016, and I started learning Java since 2018. I have built several projects, notable ones are displayed on my [GitHub](https://github.com/LaFriska)
profile. From my studies at ANU, I familiarised myself with many programming paradigms, including the following.
- Functional Programming (FP), I've worked with purely functional languages like [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP), highly experienced in Java and worked with C# and C++.
- Procedural Programming, experienced using Python, along with libraries such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). I am also proficient in Javascript, and low-level languages like ARM assembly.

### Cybersecurity

I am very passionate about cybersecurity. I am specifically interested in cryptography, for which
I have written a [literature review](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/392693096_Six_Years_of_Neural_Distinguishers_Implications_on_Cryptanalysis_of_Advanced_Encryption_Standard) during an introductory research course at ANU. In my third and fourth year at
ANU, I plan to take various cybersecurity courses to deepen my knowledge of this field. A project I plan to do over the summmer
of 2025, is to build a VPN from scratch, which drills in what I've learnt in COMP2700 (cybersecurity) and COMP2310 (Systems, Networks,
and Concurrency).

### Systems and Architecture

The fundamental workings of a modern computer is also an interest of mine. For one of my courses in 2025, I have built a fully functioning
CPU for ANU's [QuAC](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/engn2219/resources/QuAC-ISA/) ISA along with extensions to the instruction
set to support function calls, conditional branching and more immediate instruction formats. The repository can be found
[here](https://github.com/LaFriska/quac-microarchitecture).

### Machine Learning

I am familiar with many statistical machine learning concepts, including the mathematics behind Neural Network architectures, Bayesian
linear regression, classification, Gaussian processes, Bayesian networks, Markov random fields, various sampling methods,
and more. I learnt these low-level mathematical knowledge in preparation for more practical machine learning courses I will
take in 2026, which will include important topics like computer vision and document analysis. I am also interested
specifically in using neural networks to distinguish ciphertexts of symmetric-key encryption algorithms from random noise,
called [neural distinguishers](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-26951-7_6).

### Mathematics

A computer scientist is nothing without maths. At ANU, I have taken several rigorous, proof-based math courses, giving me
foundational mathematical thinking, and teaching me important mathematical methods. I am familiar with number theory,
real analysis, linear algebra, multi-variable calculus, discrete mathematics, and abstract algebra (groups, rings and modules).
