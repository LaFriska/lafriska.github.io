## About Me

Hey there! I'm Harold, a current student at the Australian National University (ANU) pursuing an Advanced
Computing Research & Development honours degree. My interests are in computer systems and architecture, operating systems, and cybersecurity. 
This website aims to serve as my CV, showing off my projects and academic achievements. This website may also contain some more informal things about me, such as some blogs or personal notes. 

My contact details is also displayed on this website. 

### Software Engineering

I am highly experienced with Java, and proficient in C, Python and JavaScript. I started coding
in 2016, and I started learning Java since 2018. I have built several projects, notable ones are displayed on my [GitHub](https://github.com/LaFriska)
profile. From my studies at ANU, I familiarised myself with many programming paradigms, including the following.
- Functional Programming (FP), I've worked with purely functional languages like [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP), highly experienced in Java and worked with C# and C++.
- Procedural Programming, experienced using Python, along with libraries such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). I am also proficient in Javascript, and low-level assembly languages.

Ever since I was kid, I've been making programming projects. I started from making animations using Scratch, to building full parsers for custom assembly languages. Today, I have several repositories public on GitHub, some contains unfinished works, but a select few contain some of my best accomplishments. I have also made open source contribution to the [Java Discord API](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA).

### Cybersecurity

My interests in cybersecurity lies in software and hardware security, as well as more theoretical cryptographic stuff.
I have written a [literature review](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/392693096_Six_Years_of_Neural_Distinguishers_Implications_on_Cryptanalysis_of_Advanced_Encryption_Standard) during an introductory research course at ANU. In my third and fourth year at ANU, I plan to take various cybersecurity courses to deepen my knowledge of this field. In 2026, I will begin a research project related to Spectre and Meltdown attacks, which are exploits conducted on (usually older) speculative CPUs which violates data confidentiality through a cache side-channel.

### Systems and Architecture

The fundamental workings of a modern computer is also a major interest of mine. After taking courses like COMP2300 and COMP2310, my love for low-level systems design and architectural concepts deepened.

### Mathematics

A computer scientist is nothing without maths. At ANU, I have taken several rigorous, proof-based math courses, giving me
foundational mathematical thinking, and teaching me important mathematical methods. I am familiar with number theory,
real analysis, linear algebra, multi-variable calculus, discrete mathematics, and abstract algebra (groups, rings and modules).
