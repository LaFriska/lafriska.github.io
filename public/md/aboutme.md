## About Me

Hey there! I'm Harold, a current student at the Australian National University (ANU) pursuing an Advanced
Computing Research & Development honours degree. My interests are in computer systems and architecture, and cybersecurity. 
This website aims to serve as a slightly less formal alternative to my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cRvE7bLuGK2FRxGdd8eCo8lvJHPJ79gVltBQ72_ruWg/edit?usp=sharing), showing off my projects and academic 
achievements. This website may also contain some random things about me, such as some blogs or personal notes. 

My contact details is also displayed on this website. 

### My Specialty

I specialise in systems and architecture, as well as cybersecurity on all levels. I am particularly interested in the
intersection between computer architecture and cybersecurity, but I am also into cryptography in particular, for which
I wrote a [literature review](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/392693096_Six_Years_of_Neural_Distinguishers_Implications_on_Cryptanalysis_of_Advanced_Encryption_Standard).
In 2026, I will soon begin a research project related to attack mitigations on speculative executing hardware with
Dr. Shoaib Akram.


### Software Engineering

*If in the future, computer systems, architecture and cybersecurity becomes my profession, then software engineering
will be my hobby.*

I am highly experienced with Java, and proficient in C and Python. I started coding
in 2016, and I started learning Java since 2018. I have built several projects, notable ones are displayed on my [GitHub](https://github.com/LaFriska)
profile. From my studies at ANU, I familiarised myself with many programming paradigms, including the following.
- Functional Programming (FP), I've worked with purely functional languages like [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP), highly experienced in Java and worked with C# and C++.
- Procedural Programming, experienced using Python, along with libraries such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). I am also proficient in Javascript, and low-level assembly languages.

Ever since I was kid, I've been making programming projects. I started from making animations using Scratch, to
building full interpreters for custom languages. Today, I have several repositories public on GitHub, 
some contains unfinished works, but a select few contain some of my best accomplishments. I have also written hundreds of lines
of additional code for open source projects like the [Java Discord API](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA).

### Employment

I have worked several times as a tutor for high school students. I am also a casual
sessional academic (tutor) for COMP2300 (computer architecture) and COMP2100 (software construction) at ANU. Check my CV
for full detail. 

### Mathematics

A computer scientist is nothing without maths. At ANU, I have taken several rigorous, proof-based math courses, giving me
foundational mathematical thinking, and teaching me important mathematical methods. I am familiar with number theory,
real analysis, linear algebra, multi-variable calculus, discrete mathematics, and abstract algebra (groups, rings and modules).
