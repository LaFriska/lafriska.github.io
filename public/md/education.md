# Education

Since childhood, I was educated in diverse international settings. I was born in Beijing, China and passed grade 4 of primary 
school, I then graduated secondary and high school in Dunedin, New Zealand, studied in Boston, USA for one semester before
residing to Canberra, Australia to complete a computing R&D degree. 

## Australian National University (ANU)
*Canberra, Australia, 2024 - Present*.

Pursuing a Bachelors of Advanced Computing (honours) (research and development) degree, I have maintained a perfect GPA
of `7.0` by passing every course I have taken with a high distinction. Below are the courses I have taken so far, along
with the grades. Note that here, an `NR` grade means "Not Released".
