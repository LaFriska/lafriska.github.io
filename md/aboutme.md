## About Me

Hey there! I'm Harold, a current student at the Australian National University (ANU) pursuing an Advanced
Computing Research & Development honours degree. My interests are in computer systems and architecture, and cybersecurity. 
This website aims to serve as a slightly less formal alternative to my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cRvE7bLuGK2FRxGdd8eCo8lvJHPJ79gVltBQ72_ruWg/edit?usp=sharing), showing off my projects and academic 
achievements. This website may also contain some random things about me, such as some blogs or personal notes.

### My Specialty

I am currently doing a specialisation in computer systems and architecture. I am particularly interested in the
intersection between computer architecture and cybersecurity.
I will soon begin a research project on attack mitigations for speculative CPUs. 

### Software Engineering

I am very experienced with Java, and proficient in C and Python. I started coding
in 2016, and I started learning Java since 2018. I've built several projects, notable ones are displayed on my [GitHub](https://github.com/LaFriska)
profile. I've also familiarised myself with some purely functional programming languages. My GitHub contains many
unfinished works, but a select few are my best accomplishments. I have also written hundreds of lines of additional code 
for open source projects like the [Java Discord API](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA).

### Employment

I have worked several times as a tutor for high school students. Starting in 2026, I will be tutoring as a
casual sessional academic for COMP2300 (computer architecture) and COMP2100 (software construction) at ANU.

### Mathematics

I have developed my mathematical maturity significantly since I started at ANU I have been educated on topics like abstract
algebra and statistical methods in machine learning.
